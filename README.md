# MediaControl
A program that automatically plays or pauses a video depending on if you are looking at the screen



**Dependencies:**

1.     
Latest version of [JAVA](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

2.     
[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)


**Directions:**

1.     
Run the program

2.     
Click start, and have the media player as the active window

3.     
Thats pretty much it, the program takes care of pausing and playing.

4.     
Click on stop when you're done

**Notes:**

·       
This is recommended for one person alone, it will work with more than one, but in order to pause,
all the faces have to turn away from the camera

·       
You must download OpenCV and add it to the
project path yourself using whichever IDE you use
